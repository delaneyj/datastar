A key was provided to the `data-ref` attribute, which is not allowed. The `data-ref` attribute only takes a value, representing the name of a signal. The signal will be assigned the element as its value.

Example:

```html
<div data-ref="signalName"></div>
```

See the docs on the [`data-ref`](https://data-star.dev/reference/plugins_core#ref) attribute.
