## Prefetch using ExecuteScript

## Demo

<div id="carousel" data-on-load="$get('/examples/prefetch/load')"></div>

## Explanation

We are loading Pokemon images in a carousel.  Know how much people love Pokemon, we are prefetching the images before they are needed.  This way, the images are already in the browser cache when they are needed.

```html
<div id="carousel" data-on-load="$get('/examples/prefetch/load')">
```

Since we have SSE we can easily load the initial page content then prefetch the images after

The interesting part of the backend (Go) is how simple it is.

```go
examplesRouter.Get("/prefetch/load", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
  sse := datastar.NewSSE(w, r)

  // render the carousel with the first image
  sse.MergeFragmentTempl(prefetchCarousel(1))

  // create a list of URLs to prefetch
  prefetchURLs := make([]string, 0, pokemonCount)
  for i := 2; i <= pokemonCount; i++ {
    prefetchURLs = append(prefetchURLs, fmt.Sprintf(pokemonURLFormat, i))
  }
  // prefetch the images
  sse.Prefetch(prefetchURLs...)
})
```

So we get fast initial page load and prefetch the images after.  This is a great way to make your site feel faster, especially when you know what the user is going to need next via the [speculation api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API).

If you are interested in the details of the script that get generated and loaded, look at your head element or the Network tab in the browser dev tools.
