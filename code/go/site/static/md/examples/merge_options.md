## Merge Options

## Demo

<div id="contents" data-on-load="@get('/examples/merge_options/reset')"></div>

## Explanation

Shows the current merge options available. For best understanding open up your dev tools and look at the contents of `#contents` to see how the merge options effect the DOM.

** Note:** This uses `#target` and can create multiple elements with the same ID (which is [not valid HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-id-attribute)) but is fine for this example. In actual use be sure to make IDs unique.
