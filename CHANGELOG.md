# WIP Release Notes for Datastar

## 0.21.0 - 2024-12-10

Weâ€™ve overhauled Datastar in v0.21.0, doubling down on making nestable signals declarative. To that end, weâ€™ve removed special characters, made the API more explicit and consistent, and fixed some restrictions to nested signals that we discovered. Signal values are now accessed in expressions using the syntax `signalName.value`, actions no longer have a prefix, and attribute keys support nested signals using dot-delimited paths.

The new [Datastar VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=starfederation.datastar-vscode) has autocomplete for all v0.21.0 `data-*`, and weâ€™ve painstakingly added error pages for every error that can be thrown.

This should be the final round of API changes before v1.0.0 ðŸš€

### Added

- Added the ability to merge one-off signals using the syntax `data-signals-foo="value"`.
- Added the ability to use dot-delimited paths to denote nested signals in applicable attribute keys (`data-signals-foo.bar="value"`).
- Added the ability to use multiple attributes using the syntax `data-attributes="{attrName1: value1, attrName2: value2}"`.
- Added the ability to use a single classes using the syntax `data-class-hidden="foo.value"`.
- Added the ability to use a key instead of a value to denote a signal name in the `data-bind`, `data-indicator` and `data-ref` attributes (`data-bind-foo`, `data-indicator-foo`, `data-ref-foo`).
- Added error codes and links to descriptions in the console for every error thrown.
- Retries and backoff are now configurable for SSE connections.

### Changed

- Signals no longer have the `$` prefix and must be acessed using a `.value` suffix (`signalName.value`).
- Action plugins no longer have the `$` prefix.
- Renamed the `data-store` attribute to `data-signals`.
- Renamed the `data-bind` attribute to `data-attributes`.
- Renamed the `data-model` attribute to `data-bind`.
- Changed the `data-*` attribute modifier delimiter from `.` to `__` for modifiers and from `_` to `.` for arguments. This is to be spec compliant while still parseable with new nested signal syntax (`data-on-keydown__debounce.100ms__throttle.noLead="value"`).
- The the `get()`, `post()`, `put()`, `patch()` and `delete()` plugins have been replaced by a single `sse()` plugin that accepts a method as an option (`sse(url, {method: 'post'})`), defaulting to `get`.
- The `setAll()` and `toggleAll` plugins now accept a path prefix, instead of a regular expression.
- Nested signals no longer allow `__` in the key. It causes a conflict with modifiers.

### Fixed

- Fixed headers not merging correctly.
- Fixed new lines in the SDK protocol for paths.
