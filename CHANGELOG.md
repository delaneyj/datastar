# WIP Release Notes for Datastar

## v0.21.3

### Added

- Added the ability to tell Datastar to ignore an element if `data-star-ignore` exists on it. Useful for preventing naming conflicts with third-party libraries.

### Changed

- The Datastar module is now exported, exposing [public methods and properties](https://data-star.dev/reference/javascript_api) ([#358](https://github.com/starfederation/datastar/issues/358)).
