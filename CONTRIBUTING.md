# Contributing to Datastar

Thanks for thinking about contributing to Datastar ðŸš€

## Before You Contribute

Before you contribute, please consider that Datastar is a lightweight JavaScript framework that aims to simplify real-time, interactive web apps by using a minimalist, attribute-based approach for state management and event handling directly in HTML.

Anything outside of this scope may not be accepted. If you have a need for a feature that is not within the scope of Datastar, consider using a Web Component or writing your own Datastar plugin.
