# Contributing to Datastar

Thanks for thinking about contributing to Datastar 🚀

## Before You Contribute

Before you contribute, please consider that Datastar is a lightweight JavaScript framework that aims to simplify real-time, interactive web apps by using a minimalist, attribute-based approach for state management and event handling directly in HTML.

Anything outside of this scope may not be accepted. If you have a need for a feature that is not within the scope of Datastar, consider using a Web Component or writing your own Datastar plugin [needs further explanation].

## Bug Reports & Feature Requests

Before submitting bug reports and feature requests, please search the [open issues](https://github.com/starfederation/datastar/issues) and the _#help_ channel in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/bnRNgZjgPh) to see if it has already been addressed. When submitting a [new issue](https://github.com/starfederation/datastar/issues/new), please use a descriptive title and include a clear description and as much relevant information as possible.

## Documentation 

Datastar’s documentation is under active development. All the markdown files live in [this folder](https://github.com/starfederation/datastar/tree/main/code/go/site/static/md). Improvements to them can be submitted via pull requests.

## Pull Requests

If you’re unsure about whether a pull request is within the scope of Datastar, please open an issue to discuss your idea first. Pull requests should have a descriptive title and clearly describe the problem and solution. If the pull request adds or changes behaviour, documentation and examples should be updated accordingly.
