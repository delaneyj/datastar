# Error: ViewTransitionKeyNotAllowed

A key was provided to the `data-view-transition` attribute. The `data-view-transition` attribute must _only_ have a value, representing a `view-transition-name`.

Example:

```html
<div data-view-transition="foo"></div>
```

See the docs on the [`data-view-transition`](https://data-star.dev/reference/plugins_browser#view-transition) attribute.
