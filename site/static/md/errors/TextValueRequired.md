# Error: TextValueRequired

No value was provided to the `data-text` attribute. The `data-text` attribute _must_ have a value, representing an expression that is evaluated used as the text content of the element.

Example:

```html
<div data-text="foo.value"></div>
```

See the docs on the [`data-text`](/reference/attribute_plugins#data-text) attribute.
