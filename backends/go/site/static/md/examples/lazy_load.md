## Lazy Load

[Original HTMX Version](https://htmx.org/examples/lazy-load/)

## Demo

<style>
.datastar-settling  {
  opacity: 0;
}
</style>

<div id="lazy_load" data-on-load="$$get('/examples/lazy_load/data')">
</div>

## Explanation

This example shows how to lazily load an element on a page. We start with an initial state that looks like this:

```html
<div data-fetch-url="" data-on-load="$$get('/examples/lazy_load/graph')">
  Loading...
</div>
```

Which shows a progress indicator as we are loading the graph. The graph is then loaded and faded gently into view via a settling CSS transition:

```css
.datastar-settling {
  opacity: 0;
}
```
