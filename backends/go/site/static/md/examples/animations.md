# Animations

[Original HTMX Version](https://htmx.org/examples/animations/)

# Explanation

Datastar is designed to allow you to use CSS transitions to add smooth animations and transitions to your web page using only CSS and HTML. Below are a few examples of various animation techniques.

Datastar also allows you to use the new View Transitions API for creating animations.

<div id="animations" data-on-load="$$get('/examples/animations/data')"></div>

## Basic CSS Animations

### Color Throb

<div>
<div id="color_throb">Color Throb Demo</div>
</div>

The simplest animation technique in Datastar is to keep the id of an element stable across a content swap. If the id of an element is kept stable, htmx will swap it in such a way that CSS transitions can be written between the old version of the element and the new one.

Consider this div:

```html
<div
  id="color_throb"
  class="p-4 text-2xl font-bold text-center uppercase transition-all duration-1000 rounded-box"
  style="background-color:#b57614;color:#83a598"
>
  blue on yellow
</div>
```

With SSE, we just update the style every second:

### Smooth Progress Bar

The [Progress Bar](/examples/progress_bar) demo uses this basic CSS animation technique as well, by updating the `length` property of a progress bar element, allowing for a smooth animation.

### View Transitions

<div id="view_transition">View Transition Demo</div>

This button swap is happening in the backend.  Each click is causing a transition of state.  The animated opacity animation is provided automatically by the View Transition API.  Doesn't matter if the targeted elements are different types, it will still "do the right thing".

## Swap Transitions

### Fade Out On Swap

<div id="fade_out_swap">Fade out swap Demo</div>

If you want to fade out an element that is going to be removed when the request ends, just send an SSE event with the opacity set to 0 and set a transition duration. This will fade out the element before it is removed.

## Settling Transitions

### Fade In On Addition

<div id="fade_me_in">Fade in Demo</div>

Building on the last example, we can fade in the new content the same way, starting from an opacity of 0 and transitioning to an opacity of 1.

## Request In Flight Animation

<div id="request_in_flight">Request in Flight Demo</div>

One of the nice features for reactivity is to show a spinner when a request is in flight. On any element that is using backend actions you can add a `data-indicator` attribute to show a spinner when the request is in flight. This can be done like so:

```html
<button
  data-fetch-indicator="'#request_in_flight_indicator'"
  data-on-click="$$post('/examples/animations/data/request_in_flight')"
  id="submit_request_in_flight"
>
  Submit
</button>
```

This will show the element with the id `request_in_flight_indicator` when the request is in flight and hide it when the request is complete.
